Speculative black hole theory: Entropy as fluid morphing into a sister dimension.
# Fluid-Horizon Morphic Interface (FHMI) Theory

A new lane in black hole physics: Information disperses into a pliable, fluid-like entropy state at the event horizon, morphing dynamically to form a "sister dimension"—a quasi-2.5D layer that co-evolves with the black hole.

## Core Concept
- **Dispersal**: Infalling matter turns into morphic fluid (high-entropy, adaptive).
- **Horizon Role**: Active membrane where info flows, folds, and re-links.
- **Sister Dimension**: Emergent patterns from entropy vortices—beyond holography.

Resolves info paradox via *transformation*, not just encoding.
